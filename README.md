# Reduce-a-gotchi

An educational in-browser game where you learn how to use reducer functions by interacting with a cute virtual pet!

## Planning

[Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/12LILRLSC8xLrwjfjqzenr/Reduce-a-gotchi?node-id=0%3A1)

## Dependencies

Attempted to use:

- [react-simple-code-editor](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor)
- [Prism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs) (syntax highlighting for the editor)

(Error: highlight is not a function, even though I'm importing highlight from Prism)

Now using [Ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace).
